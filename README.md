# Latex Resume

This is a resume written in the LateX format which we con control the formatting with the source code.

## Compilation

To compile the final pdf file, we need to have a command-line tool for that e.g. `texlive` in Debian.

### Debian

Please run the following command below to install `texlive-full`.

`apt-get install texlive-full`

Finally, run `xelatex resume.tex`. After successful execution, you will get `resume.pdf` file at the current directory.

### Mac

`Please find your own way, it's easy peasy. xD`
