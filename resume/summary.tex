Current a Software Engineer at the blockchain company, \textbf{OmiseGO}. At \textbf{OmiseGO}, we do really care about the code quality, we're trying our best to make sure our code is concise and simple. I'm working on many technologies involving with both front-end and back-end stuffs. But primarily on the front-end side e.g. the mobile application for demonstrating the \textbf{eWallet} (https://github.com/omisego/ewallet) functionalities and also building the sdk for the Android developer. At the moment, due to the prioritization, I was assigned to work on the new application using \textbf{React Native} to work with our core product and getting closer to the \textbf{Ethereum Blockchain}.
